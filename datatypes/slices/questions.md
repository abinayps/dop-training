1. Create a slice of length 10 and capacity 20. Print its length and capacity.

2. Append 15 integers to an empty slice and print the slice, its length, and capacity after each append operation.

1. Write a function that takes a slice of integers and returns a new slice with the elements reversed.

2. Given two slices, create a new slice that combines elements from both.
a := []int{1, 2, 3}
b := []int{4, 5, 6}


3. Write a function that inserts a value at a given index in a slice of integers.
The function must return a new slice with the value inserted and all elements shifted accordingly.
nums := []int{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
index := 2
value := 99



4. Write a function that divides a slice into multiple smaller slices (chunks) of a given size.
The last chunk may be smaller if elements don’t fit evenly.
nums := []int{10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
chunkSize := 3


5. Create a map where keys are student names and values are their scores.
Write a function to:
-add a student
-update a student's score
-print all students and scores
